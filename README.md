# Investigate_TMDb_Movies_Dataset

## Project Overview

#### In this project, we have to analyze a dataset and then communicate our findings about it. We will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

#### This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb),including user ratings and revenue.

- Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiplevalues separated by pipe (|) characters.

- There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry about cleaning them. You can leave them as is.

- The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.
- 

### What do I need to install? You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:

- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
